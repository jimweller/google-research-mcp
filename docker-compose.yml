# Docker Compose for local HTTP transport testing.
#
# Usage:
#   1. Copy .env.example to .env and fill in your API keys.
#   2. Run: docker compose up --build
#   3. Test: curl http://localhost:3000/health
#
# This runs the server in HTTP transport mode (not STDIO).
# OAuth is not required for local testing unless you configure it.
