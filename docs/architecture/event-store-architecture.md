# Deep Dive: Event Store Architecture

This document provides a detailed technical explanation of the server's `PersistentEventStore`. It is intended for developers who need to understand how session resumption for the HTTP/SSE transport is implemented.

For a higher-level view, please see the main [**Architecture Guide**](./architecture.md).

## The Purpose of the Event Store

The Event Store's sole purpose is to enable **session resumption** for clients using the HTTP/SSE transport. When a web-based client communicates with the server, it maintains a persistent connection to receive a stream of events (responses). If this connection is interrupted (e.g., due to a network drop), the client can reconnect and "catch up" on any missed messages.

The Event Store is the component that makes this possible by acting as a durable, short-term memory for all messages sent by the server.

## Component Diagram

The `PersistentEventStore` shares a similar architecture with the caching system, using a `PersistenceManager` to handle disk I/O.

## Core Components

### `PersistentEventStore`
-   **File**: [`src/shared/persistentEventStore.ts`](../src/shared/persistentEventStore.ts)
-   **Description**: The main class that implements the `EventStore` interface required by the MCP SDK's `StreamableHTTPServerTransport`. It orchestrates the storage and retrieval of events.
-   **Key Responsibilities**:
    -   Managing an in-memory `Map` of recent events for fast access.
    -   Generating unique, chronologically sortable event IDs.
    -   Enforcing limits on the number of events stored (per-stream and globally) to prevent memory exhaustion.
    -   Handling event expiration (TTL).
    -   Coordinating with the `EventPersistenceManager` for disk-based persistence.
    -   Providing optional hooks for encryption, access control, and audit logging.

### `EventPersistenceManager`
-   **File**: [`src/shared/eventPersistenceManager.ts`](../src/shared/eventPersistenceManager.ts)
-   **Description**: An abstraction layer over the filesystem, responsible for all disk I/O operations.
-   **Key Responsibilities**:
    -   Organizing events on disk into directories based on their `streamId` (which corresponds to a client's session ID).
    -   Performing **atomic writes** for each event to prevent data corruption.
    -   Loading event streams from disk when a client reconnects and its session is not fully in memory.

## Data Flow and Logic

### Storing an Event

1.  The **HTTP/SSE Transport** sends a message to a client.
2.  It calls `eventStore.storeEvent()` with the `streamId` and the message.
3.  The `PersistentEventStore` generates a new `eventId`.
4.  The event is added to the in-memory `Map`.
5.  The store checks if any limits (e.g., `maxEventsPerStream`) have been exceeded and evicts the oldest events if necessary.
6.  The `EventPersistenceManager` is called to write the new event to a JSON file on disk (e.g., `storage/event_store/<streamId>/<eventId>.json`).

### Replaying Events (Session Resumption)

1.  A client reconnects to the HTTP/SSE endpoint, providing the `lastEventId` it successfully received.
2.  The transport calls `eventStore.replayEventsAfter(lastEventId)`.
3.  The `PersistentEventStore` first searches its in-memory `Map` for all events belonging to that stream that occurred after `lastEventId`.
4.  If the `lastEventId` is too old to be in memory, it asks the `EventPersistenceManager` to load the relevant event stream from disk.
5.  Once the full sequence of missed events is gathered, they are sent back to the client in the correct order.

## Configuration and Usage

Like the cache, the `PersistentEventStore` is instantiated as a **global singleton** in `src/server.ts` to ensure a single, unified store is used across the entire application.

```typescript
// Simplified example from src/server.ts
const eventStoreInstance = new PersistentEventStore({
  storagePath: path.resolve(__dirname, '..', 'storage', 'event_store'),
  eventTTL: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000, // 24 hours
  maxEventsPerStream: 1000,
  persistenceInterval: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
  eagerLoading: true, // Load all events from disk on startup
});
```

This singleton instance is then passed to the `StreamableHTTPServerTransport` during its initialization.

## Shutdown and Data Integrity

The `PersistentEventStore` registers its `dispose` method with the same global shutdown handler as the cache. This ensures that when the server terminates, any events still in the in-memory store are flushed to disk in a final, synchronous write, preventing data loss and ensuring reliable session resumption even across server restarts.
