# Project Roadmap & Implementation Status

**Date:** July 6, 2025
**Version:** 3.0
**Status:** Core Implementation Complete. Focus on Production Hardening.

## 1. Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the `google-researcher-mcp` server's development status and a forward-looking roadmap. The project has successfully implemented its foundational features, including compliance with MCP SDK v1.11.0 and a robust OAuth 2.1 security model.

The focus has now shifted from initial implementation to production hardening, addressing critical security gaps, and implementing key functional enhancements required for a public release. This roadmap supersedes the previous `mcp_server_improvement_plan.md` and `security-improvements-implementation-guide.md` documents.

| **Source Attribution**             | Add an option to `research_topic` to return source URLs for verification.                               | **High**   |
| **Failed Source Handling**         | Gracefully handle and report failed scrapes within the `research_topic` tool.                           | **High**   |
| **Recency Filtering**              | Add a parameter to `google_search` to filter results by time (e.g., last week, last month).             | **Medium** |
| **Advanced Research Controls**     | Add `depth` and `focus` parameters to `research_topic` to control the scope and detail of research.     | **Medium** |

## 4. Detailed Implementation Plans

### 4.1. SSRF Mitigation for `scrape_page` (P1 - Critical)

The `scrape_page` tool currently accepts any URL, creating a significant Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability.

**Mitigation Steps:**
1.  **URL Validation:** Rigorously parse and validate the structure of the input URL.
2.  **Protocol Restriction:** Only allow `http:` and `https:` protocols.
3.  **IP-based Blocking:**
    -   Resolve the URL's domain to an IP address.
    -   Block requests to private, reserved, and loopback IP ranges (e.g., `127.0.0.1`, `10.0.0.0/8`, `192.168.0.0/16`).
4.  **Domain Allow-listing (Optional but Recommended):** Maintain a configurable list of trusted domains that can be scraped.
5.  **Disable Redirects:** Configure the HTTP client to prevent following redirects, which could bypass initial checks.

### 4.2. Production Secrets Management (P1 - High)

Storing secrets in `.env` files is not suitable for production.

**Action Items:**
1.  **Select a Secrets Manager:** Evaluate and choose a secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS/GCP Secrets Manager).
2.  **Abstract Secret Loading:** Create a module that abstracts the loading of secrets, supporting both `.env` for development and the chosen manager for production.
3.  **Implement Rotation Policy:** Establish a policy and process for regularly rotating all secrets.

### 4.3. Rate Limiting (P1 - Medium)

The server currently has no protection against high-volume requests.

**Implementation Plan:**
1.  **Use `express-rate-limit`:** Integrate the `express-rate-limit` middleware.
2.  **Keying Strategy:**
    -   For authenticated requests, key the limit on the user's identifier from the OAuth token (`req.oauth.sub`).
    -   For unauthenticated requests (if any), fall back to the IP address (`req.ip`).
3.  **Configuration:** Make rate limits configurable via environment variables.
