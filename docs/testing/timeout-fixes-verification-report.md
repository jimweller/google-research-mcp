- **Verification:** Timeouts trigger correctly, graceful degradation works

### 6. Stress Tests ✅

#### ✅ Timeout Trigger Verification
- **Status:** PASS
- **Result:** 10-second delay URL handled in 15,005ms (timeout + retries)
- **Verification:** Timeouts actually trigger and don't cause hangs

#### ✅ Concurrent Operations
- **Status:** PASS
- **Result:** 3/3 concurrent operations successful in 344ms
- **Verification:** Multiple simultaneous requests work with timeout protection

#### ✅ Research Under Stress
